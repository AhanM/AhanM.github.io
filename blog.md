<p class="message">
  This is going to be a blog about my experiences and learning from everyday life. Hopefully this wont be too tech heavy but if it is I'm good enough at explaining whatever jargon I use.  
</p>

All my life I've found myself explaining or simplifying complicated-looking concepts and strengthening my own understanding in the process. This is why I thought it would be a good idea to make a blog to assimilate important lessons that I learn and hopefully summarise it into one post and share it.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this website include:

* Built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Best Friend](https://open.spotify.com/track/47Bg6IrMed1GPbxRgwH2aC?si=YRowfgmVSAOADl1aCWytjg)
